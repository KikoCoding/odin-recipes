    <h3>Description</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Francesinha is a mixed sandwich that is made with a layer of bread, a steak, two different sausages, cheese, ham, bread,
         cover the sandwich with cheese, then melt all the cheese, egg on the top, fries on the side, and every
         thing covered with a hot sauce (a little bit spicy without being too spicy).<br>Known as Little French or Frenchie, we have
          to be honest with you: the only thing little about Francesinha is the name.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients (1 person)</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices Loaf Bread (thick cut)</li>
        <li>1 Linguiça</li>
        <li>1 Sausage (salsicha fresca)</li>
        <li>2 slices Ham (sliced thin)</li>
        <li>2 slices Baloney (sliced thin)<li>
        <li>1 steak Rump steak (cut thin)</li>
        <li>5-6 slices Flamengo cheese slices</li>
        <li>130 g Fries (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Slightly toast the bread – in the oven or in the toaster but without smooshing it, so it doesn’t lose its thickness.</li>
        <li>Cook the steak medium/rare and allow it to rest away from the heat for a few minutes, to retain the juices. Slit it slightly so that it’s easier to cut later on.</li>
        <li>Cut the linguiça and the Italian sausage length wise and trim them, if necessary, to match the size of the bread. Cook them in the same pan as the steak.</li>
        <li>Fry the egg(s) in the same pan again (optional). Fry the potatoes on the side (opcional).</li>
        <li>Assembling: after toasted, place one slice of bread in a deep dish that can go in the oven, and lay the slices of ham and baloney over the bread; place the sausage and the linguiça interspersed, side by side, and then the steak; place the second slice of bread on top and cover it all with cheese slices.</li>
        <li>Turn on the broil and place it in the oven until the cheese has melted.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, (place the egg on top), pour at least two ladles of sauce over the francesinha and serve immediatly.</li>
        <li>Pour the rest of the sauce in a gravy boat and serve seperately (as well as the fries).</li>
    </ol>
